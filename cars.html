<h1>bmw m4</h1>
<h2>The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series coupes and convertibles developed by BMW's motorsport division, BMW M, and marketed since 2014.
    <ol>

    As part of the renumbering that splits the 3 Series coupé and convertible models into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced the BMW M3 coupé and convertible models. Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, suspension, exhaust system, brakes and weight reduction measures including increased use of carbon fibre, such as on the roof of the car.[1]
