    <h2>
      The BMW M5 is a high performance variant of the BMW 5 Series marketed
      under the BMW M sub-brand. It is considered an iconic vehicle in the
      sports sedan category.[1][2] The majority of M5s have been produced in the
      sedan (saloon) body style, but in some countries the M5 was also available
      as a wagon (estate) from 1992 to 1995 and from 2006 to 2010.[3][4] The
      first M5 model was hand-built in 1985 on the E28 535i chassis with a
      modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production sedan at
      the time.[5] M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5
      Series since 1985.
