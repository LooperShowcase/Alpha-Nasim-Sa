 <h1>bmw m3</h1>
<h2>The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3 Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport division, BMW M GmbH. M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3 Series since the E30 M3 was introduced in 1986.

  The initial model was available in a coupé body style, with a convertible body style added soon after. M3 saloons were available during the E36 (1994–1999) and E90 (2008–2012) generations. Since 2014, the coupé and convertible models have been rebranded as the 4 Series range, making the high-performance variant the M4, so that generation of 3 Series saw the M3 produced only as a saloon. In 2020, the M3 was produced as an estate (Touring) for the first time, alongside the saloon.[1][2]

<p>The BMW M3 has a madness inside it. Its standard powertrain bottles up 473 horsepower from a twin-turbo straight-six, shoots it through a six-speed manual transmission, and wastes no time delivering it to the rear tires. And that’s only the start. The M3 Competition, which is only offered with an eight-speed automatic, increases horsepower to 503 and is offered with your choice of rear- or all-wheel drive. With all that power, you’d think the M3 would be incapable of doing slow, but even when driven at law-abiding speeds, it’s quite nice. While rivals such as the Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing and Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio feel at times more refined and less edgy, there isn’t a wrong choice among the three brands’ super sedans. For an even more righteous experience, there’s the new-for-2024 M3 CS. It sheds an estimated 75 pounds from the base M3 and hammers the pavement with 543 horsepower and all-wheel drive.

    <h2>A battle royale game is an online multiplayer video game genre that blends last-man-standing gameplay with the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a survival game. Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players, who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking "safe area", with the winner being the last player or team alive.

      The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, itself based on the novel of the same name, which presents a similar theme of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone. The genre's origins arose from mods for large-scale online survival games like Minecraft and ARMA 2 in the early 2010s. By the end of the decade, the genre became a cultural phenomenon, with standalone games such as PUBG: Battlegrounds (2017), Fortnite Battle Royale (2017), Apex Legends (2019) and Call of Duty: Warzone (2020) each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases.
